# Neuroevolution
Playing around training neural networks with genetic algorithms. Currently have the retro game "Snake" built and have successfully trained a neural network using a standard GA approach (fitness,selection,crossover,mutation) to suruvie and score upwards 70+ food eaten.

Population: 100
Selection: Top 10%
Fitness function: # of food eaten
Mutation rate: 10%
Mutation amount: 0.1
